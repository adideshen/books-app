Book Search Web Application
Welcome to my Book Search Web Application project! This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books and save their favorites. Users can create an account to save their favorite books.

Overview
This project was developed as part of the Queenbe Association's summer program. Throughout the development process, I received guidance and support as needed. The application is implemented using JavaScript for both the frontend and backend components. The frontend is built using React, while the backend utilizes Node.js and Express. The Google Books API is used to fetch book information.

Start the Application: Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the application:

Access the Website: After executing the command, the website will automatically open in your default web browser.

Notes
