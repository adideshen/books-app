Book Search Web Application

Welcome to the Book Search Web Application project! This is a full-stack project that serves as a web application for searching books. Users can also register on the site and save a list of their favorite books.

Overview
The application is implemented using JavaScript for both the frontend and backend components. The frontend is built using React, while the backend is built using Node.js and Express. The backend interacts with a locally created user table in PostgreSQL, enabling the addition of new users and authentication for existing users. The Google Books API is used to fetch book information from Google Books.
This project was completed as part of the QueenB Association's summer program, during which guidance were provided as needed.
